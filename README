Win32-Process-CpuUsage version 0.01
===================================

This module tries to get the CPU usage and command line parameter of a Windows process, and the system CPU usage.
It reuses 
	code from Win32::Process::CommandLine for getting the process's command line parameter, 
		http://search.cpan.org/~kxj/Win32-Process-CommandLine-0.03/

	code from Win32::SystemInfo::CpuUsage for getting system CPU usage, 
		http://search.cpan.org/~kxj/Win32-SystemInfo-CpuUsage-0.02/

There isn't dependency among these 3 modules, which serve different purpose.

Build Environment
	. Use h2xs to generate module skeleton: h2xs -O -x -n Win32::Process::CpuUsage CpuUsage.h
	. This module uses GetProcessTimes and GetSystemTimes to calculate the CPU usage percentage.
	
	. If use VC++ 6 to compile, you need Microsoft Platform SDK. GetSystemTimes doesn't exist in VC++6 's header files.
	. Visual C++ 2008 Express should compile this module. http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/
	. Here is the reference for how to calculate the percentage:
		http://www.codeproject.com/KB/threads/Get_CPU_Usage.aspx
	. A standalone project is in folder exe that can be loaded and compiled by MS Visual Studio.
